# Family Networks

This R code makes family networks using the naming convention used in the Philippines and set forth in Cruz, Labonne, and Querubin (2016) & Querubin (2011).

## Rules

It is possible to approximate actual family networks in the Philippines is possible because of strict patterns of name inheritance. 

## Functions
I provide three functions for constructing different types of networks. 

  *buildFamilyNetwork_Ind* builds *individual* level networks, meaning that individuals are the nodes in the network.
  
  *buildFamilyNetwork_Fam* builds *family* level networks, so that each family name is a node in the network.
  
  *buildFamilyNetwork_Community* builds *community* level networks. Communities, such as barangay, are the nodes in the network and relations between individuals in the different communities determine the presence or absence, and strength of ties between them.
